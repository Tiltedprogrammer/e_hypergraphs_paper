\section*{Section}

Slotted e-graphs~\cite{slotted-egraphs} are an extension of e-graphs with two main objectives (apart from representing sets of equivalent terms)
\begin{itemize}
  \item Uniquely represent terms that are different up to a `renaming' of free variables, i.e., terms $a + b$ and $c + d$ where $a,b,c,d$ are distinct variables are represented as the same e-node.
  \item Uniquely represent terms that are different up to renaming of bound variables, i.e., terms $\text{bind}\;\$s_1\; t_1$ and $\text{bind}\; \$s_2\;t_2$ are represented by the same e-node if $(s_1 \; s') \text{bind}\; \$s_1\;t_1 = (s_2 \; s') \text{bind}\;\$s_2\;t_2$ where $s'$ is a fresh name.
\end{itemize}

The first is achieved by parameterising each e-class by the ordered set of free variables (\textit{slots}) the terms of the e-class contain.
For example, a term $a + b$ contains two free variables $a$ and $b$ and therefore the e-class that contains this term is parameterised by two variables.
Non duplication of $a + b$ and $c + d$ is achieved by computing normal forms (\textit{shapes}) of such terms.
In this particular example the shape is $\$0 + \$1$.
One of the components of a slotted e-graph is a hash-map that maps such shapes to e-class id's that contain equivalent terms.
Since two terms evaluate to the same shape, they correspond to a singe entry in an e-graph.

The other one is achieved by both computing the shape and generating a fresh slot each time a term with a binder is added to an e-graph.
This makes it impossible to write a capturing $\beta$-reduction such as $(\lambda x . \lambda y . x) y$.

Both of the above objectives can be achieved by using string diagrams for Cartesian closed SMCs by essentially performing a closure conversion of every functional symbol.

Consider the example in Figure~\ref{fig:slotted_a_b_c_d} where subfigure (c) represents a term $(a + b) + (c + d)$ and note how subterms for $(a+b)$ and $(c + d)$ are shared.
The headers of e-classes specify which free variables parameterise the e-class.
Subfigure (d) represents an e-graph after an equivalent term $a + (b + (c + d))$ was added.

\begin{figure}
  \includegraphics[width=0.5\linewidth]{figures/slotted_a_b_c_d_example}
  \caption{Slotted e-graph example~\cite{slotted-egraphs}}
  \label{fig:slotted_a_b_c_d}
\end{figure}

We can express the same data using string diagrams as in Figure~\ref{fig:slotted_a_b_c_d_string_1}.
Note that there is no 1-to-1 corresponding between the slotted e-graph and the resulting string diagram (unlike in Figure~\ref{fig:slotted_a_b_c_d_string_2} which can not be obtained by applying rewrite rules to the initial string diagram).
However, the e-box in red roughly corresponds to the invocations $(a)\;(b,c,d)$ and $(a,b)\;(c,d)$ of the slotted e-graph.
We can decompose a string diagram in such a way because of the copy-delete rule.
Also note that we can technically achieve more sharing by not only doing closure conversion on subtrees but on subgraphs as well, i.e., we could share the $\lambda x y . x + y$ 3 times instead of 2.

In the presence of $\beta$-reduction rule we need a richer structure for our string diagrams though.
Consider a term $(\lambda\; x\; .\; f\;x)\; y$ which evaluates to $f \; y$ under $\beta$-reduction.
The corresponding slotted e-graph (after a $\beta$-reduction has been applied) can be seen in Figure~\ref{fig:f_x_y_slotted}.
Note that it contains a cycle (the rightmost \texttt{app} e-node references \texttt{bind} and the latter references the e-class containing \texttt{app} again).
This e-graph contains an infinite family of terms: $(\lambda\; x\; .\; f\;x)\; y$, $f \; y$, $(\lambda\; x\; .\; (\lambda z\; .\; f\;z) x\; y$ and so on.
To fully support this, we need a trace.
An example could be seen in Figure~\ref{fig:f_x_y_string_traced}.
